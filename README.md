### Network Levels

1. **First Level**
2. **Second Level**
3. **Third Level**

### Common Equipment Across Levels

- **Main Router**: Manages the network traffic between different levels and external connections.
- **Switches**: Provide local network connectivity for devices within each level.
- **Printer**: Shared printing capabilities accessible across the network.
- **PCs**: Desktop computers used by employees for daily work.
- **Access Points**: Provide wireless connectivity for laptops and mobile devices.

## Level 1: Ground Floor

### Equipment
- **1 Main Router**: Connects Level 1 to the external network.
- **2 Switches**: Provides local network connectivity for devices.
- **1 Printer**: Shared printer accessible to all devices.
- **4 PCs**: Desktop computers for employees.

### Connectivity
- Devices connect to switches for local communication.
- All devices can access the shared printer.

## Level 2: Second Floor

### Equipment
- **2 Switches**: Provides local network connectivity.
- **1 Printer**: Shared printer accessible to all devices.
- **2 Access Points**: Provide wireless connectivity.
- **4 PCs**: Desktop computers for employees.
- **2 Wireless Laptops**: Portable devices with wireless connectivity.

### Connectivity
